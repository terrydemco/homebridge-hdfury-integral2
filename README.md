## Installation instructions

After [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) has been installed:

 ```sudo npm install -g homebridge-integral2```

### Configuration

```json
{
  "bridge": {
      ...
  },
  "platforms": [
    {
      "platform": "Integral2",
      "devices": [
        {
          "name": "Integral2",
          "port": "/dev/serial0",
          "pollingInterval": 60000
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

For testing purposes only

### Disable serial TTY on RPi

On a Raspberry Pi you additionally need to:

- Disable the login shell on the serial port
- Keep the serial port hardware enabled

If you run homebridge, the user account running homebridge must be a member of the dialout group.

## Supported clients
